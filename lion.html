      <h3>NEARLY ALL WILD LIONS LIVE IN AFRICA, BUT ONE SMALL POPULATION EXISTS ELSEWHERE</h3>
      <p>In the wild, there are two formally recognised lion subspecies. The African lion (Panthera leo leo) is found in Africa, below the Sahara desert. The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) exists in one small population around Gir Forest National Park in western India.</p>

      <h3>MALE LIONS CAN WEIGH 30 STONE</h3>
      <p>On average, male lions weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females weigh 126kg (almost 20 stone).  They need this weight and power behind them to hunt large prey and defend their pride</p>

      <h3>THE MAGNIFICENT MANES ON MALE LIONS TELL A STORY</h3>
      <p>Male lions grow impressive manes the older they get. These manes grow up to 16cm long and are a sign of dominance. The older they get, the darker their manes go. </p>

      <h3>LION CUBS ARE REARED TOGETHER</h3>
      <p>A pride of lions is usually made up of related females and their cubs, plus a male or small group of males who defend their pride. The lionesses rear their cubs together and cubs can suckle from any female with milk.</p>

    <article class="second_article">
      <h3>LIONS CAN GET THEIR WATER FROM PLANTS</h3>
      <p>Lions are highly adaptable and can live in very dry areas like the Kalahari Desert. Here they get most of their water from their prey and will even drink from plants such as the Tsamma melon.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="second_article">
      <h3>LIONS ARE BIG EATERS</h3>
      <p>Lions can eat up to 40kg of meat in a single meal - around a quarter of their body weight.  Their tongues have sharp-pointed rasps, called papillae, which are used to scrape meat off the bones.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="second_article">
      <h3>THEY HUNT DURING STORMS</h3>
      <p>Lions do most of their hunting at night as their eyes have adapted to the dark and this gives them a huge advantage over their prey.  They hunt more during storms as the noise and wind make it harder for prey to see and hear them. When hunting, lionesses have specific roles. Some play the role of 'centre' and others the role of 'wing' - the wings chase the prey towards the centres.</p>

      <h3>LIONS ARE THE ONLY CATS WHO ROAR TOGETHER</h3>
      <p>Lions are the only known cat species where individuals roar together - with even young cubs joining in with their mews. The calling sequence usually lasts about 40 seconds.  A group of lions, also called 'a pride', often roar together to mark their territory - a roar can be heard from 5 miles away.</p>

      <h3>THERE ARENT AS MANY LIONS AS YOUD THINK</h3>
      <p>There are thought to be as few as 23,000 lions left in the wild. When you think there are around 415,000 wild African elephants, you realise lion numbers are incredibly low.  In fact, lions have disappeared from over 90% of their historical range.</p>
